- some functions returns useful value to the calling code, while others performs and actions (also called procedures)
- the return value should return into a object
- a function that is bound to a class is called a method - methods specify the object they act on using the dot.
- can be used anywhere python expects an expression
- functions can call other functions
- usually functions are in their own module to be imported
- calling a function: variable_name = function_name(arguments)

Note that python is not static type i.e. it does not strongly enforce input type matching, although some IDEs will highlight type mismatch


``` python
def function_name(formal_parameters_arguments):
	＃function code
	return return_value
#have 2 blank lines to separate functions
#after the functions
``` 

Passing values (formal parameters)
- arguments vs parameters - (placeholders for the actual values i.e. arguments). parameters gets the value of the argument passed into the function
- arguments are passed by assignment/passed by reference, but immutable objects are passed by value
- python was more of "call by sharing"/"call by assignment" rather than passing (ref python documentation)
- some parameters can be assigned default values
- parameters exist in the function only - it gets the value (bound) of the argument passed into the function
- "positional argument" - assigned by order vs "keyword arguments" - keyword parameters can have default values. note when passing arguments when calling functions you don’t have to specify the keyword explcitly if you are only providing the first keyword argument, but you have to provide the keyword when providing the second parameter onwards - this also means you don't need to provide keyword Rguments in their order
- generally not a good idea to name your global variables the same as your param variables

positional or keyword must come first in the parameter list. var positional must come after. keyword arguments must come after
var keyword will be last 


Return
- code after the return statement will not be executed
- if return value if not explicitly returned, it will return none

Scoping
- variables only exist inside the function when called

Throwing Exceptions
``` python
raise TypeofError(“user text prompt”)
``` 

Docstrings: 
- help explain what a function does. specify params and return values
	defined by """ and ends with """
- inside a function (as compared to Java, before the code)
- is a function attribute. i.e. the function is an object and hence can have attributes. meaning you c an prin t the docstring i.e myfunction.__doc__
- ref PEP257. restructed text format vs google convention (ref google’s python style guide) in intellij settings
- you can using single back ticks for python names that are variable, function or class. must be separated by spaces
- indicating the return tupe using -> TYPE: after the def header
- can return NONE
- indicate the parameter type with (parameterName: TYPE)
- annotating your functions with type hints and default values -> bool or -> None, screen_width : int. ref pep8 for formatting rules. you should annotate all fields or don't annotate at all


Modules
- a .py file that contains definitions and statements
- modules can be imported into other modules to be executed
- whl files (python wheels) contain a package


Adding colours to printing in the terminal
- formatting with escape character with ANSI colour sequences at the start of the text
- must be reset otherwise colour will continue
- can use colourama package
- You can format the output text in colour
``` python
print(RED,"Red Text")
# this will remain until changed or reset
or print("{0}{1}{2}".format(effect,text,RESET))
# Some ANSI escape sequences for colours and effects
BLACK = '\u001b[30m'
RED = '\u001b[31m'
GREEN = '\u001b[32m'
YELLOW = '\u001b[33m'
BLUE = '\u001b[34m'
MAGENTA = '\u001b[35m'
CYAN = '\u001b[36m'
WHITE = '\u001b[37m'
RESET = '\u001b[0m'
BOLD = '\u001b[1m'
UNDERLINE = '\u001b[4m'
REVERSE = '\u001b[7m
```

Virtual Environments
- using pip to install packages
- venv is an isolated installation of python. useful when managing versions
- tick use site packages to allow venv python to have access to main python packages
- can also use conda environments
- run activate from venv directory


*args:
- used to unpack sequences, or specify a parameter is an unpacked sequences e.g. tuple or list
- args is the packed sequence and *args is an unpacked sequence
- use it to supply a list of arguments into a function as a sequence
- “variable number of parameters”, which is packed into a tuple that can be used in the function
- **kwargs used for dictionaries 

5 types of parameters (5 rules) and their order: positional or keyword, var-positional i.e. *, keyword only, var keyword

``` python 
def func(p1, p2, *args, k, **kwargs):
    # print stuff
	
	
func(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, k=6, key1=7, key2=8)
# positional-or-keyword: 1, 2
# var-positional (*args): (3, 4, 5)
# keyword: 6
# var-keyword: {'key1': 7, 'key2': 8}
```
