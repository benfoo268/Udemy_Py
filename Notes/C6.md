	some functions returns useful value to the calling code, while others performs and actions (also called procedures)
	the return value should return into a object
	a function that is bound to a class is called a method - methods specify the object they act on using the dot.

def function_name(formal_parameters_arguments):
	…
	return return_value
#have 2 blank lines to separate functions
#after the functions

Passing values (formal arugments)
	arguments vs parameters
	some arguments can have default values
	arguments are passed by assignment/passed by reference
	immutable objects are passed by value
	python was more of "call by sharing"/"call by assignment" rather than passing (ref python documentation)
	parameters exist in the function only - it gets the value (bound) of the argument passed into the function
	"positional argument" - assigned by order vs "keyword arguments"
	keyword parameters? can have default values. not when passing arguments you don’t have to specify the keyword explcitly if you only have one keyword argument?

do parameters need to be stongly typed?

Scoping
	parameters only exist inside the function when called

Handling Exceptions
	raise TypeofError(“user text prompt”)
	
Docstrings: 
	help explain what a function does
	defined by *** and ends with ***
	inside a function (as compared to Java, before the code)
	is a function attribute
	ref PEP257. restructed text format vs google convention (ref google’s python style guide)
	annotating your functions with type hints and default values

Modules
	a .py file that contains definitions and statements
	modules can be imported into other modules to be executed

Adding colours to printing in the terminal
	formatting with escape character with ANSI colour sequences

Look through all HiLo game content - has to do with binary search



*args:
	used to unpack sequences, or specify a parameter is an unpacked sequences
	args is the packed sequence and *args is an unpacked sequence
	use it to supply a list of arguments into a function as a sequence
“variable number of parameters”
5 types of parameters (5 rules): positional or keyword, positional only, keyword only, var positional, var keyword
refer to Python documentation

A function bound to an instance of a class is called a method.

Defining and Using Functions:
def function_name(parameters):
    #functioncode
    return return_value
#leave2blanklinesafterthefunctions

variable_name = function_name(arguments)

scoping rules and variables 
parameters i.e. formal parameters are filled by arguments when a function is called i.e. passing arguments 
- positional or keyword arguments 
passed by assignment or pass by reference
immutable objects are passed by value but this doesn’t mean much 
- keyword arguments and default values

all functions must return a value, although you can return none. if you don’t have a return statement, it will return a default value of none. some functions only perform actions and don’t return values

more methods:
.isnumeric (ints only)
.isalphanumeric
.center

handling exceptions:
raise TYPEOFERROR(“PROMPT”)

docstrings for functions or classes:
- forces you to think about what your function is doing
- describe parameters and return values
- IDE CRTLQ
- after the function definition “”” unlike C or Java before the definition. it is a function attribute so you can print using .__doc__ in case you dont have an IDE
- pycharm restructured format vs google format cf link c.f PEP 257
- using single back ticks for python names that are variable, function or class
- you can put functions into modules. module has a .py file type

Type hints
- indicating the return tupe using -> TYPE: after the def header
    - can return NONE
- indicate the parameter type with (parameterName: TYPE)

whl files contain a package

note that python is not static type i.e. it does not strongly enforce input type matching, although some IDEs will highlight type mismatch

You can format the output text in colour
PRINT(RED,"Red Text")
- this will remain until changed or reset
or print("{0}{1}{2}".format(effect,text,RESET))
# Some ANSI escape sequences for colours and effects
BLACK = '\u001b[30m'
RED = '\u001b[31m'
GREEN = '\u001b[32m'
YELLOW = '\u001b[33m'
BLUE = '\u001b[34m'
MAGENTA = '\u001b[35m'
CYAN = '\u001b[36m'
WHITE = '\u001b[37m'
RESET = '\u001b[0m'
 
BOLD = '\u001b[1m'
UNDERLINE = '\u001b[4m'
REVERSE = '\u001b[7m'

*args allow you to provide more than one argument, or even zero
• before unpacks values 
• specify that a parameter is an unpacked sequence (i.e single input for the function to use)
if * args is unpacked, args is packed

positional or keyword must come first in the parameter list
var positional must come after
keyword arguments must come after
var keyword will be last 

**kwargs used for dictionaries
