# age = int(input("How old are you?:"))
# if age >=16 and age <=65: #note python is case sensitive "and" vs "AND"
#     print("Have a good day at work")
# # Simplified chain comparison:
# if 16<= age <=65:
#     print("Have a good day at work")
# else:
#     print("Enjoy your free time")
# print ("-" *80 )

# if age <=16 or age <= 65: #note it is always carrot first <=,>=,==
#     print("Enjoy your free time")
