Dictionaries and sets are not sequences and cannot be indexed into, 
Dictionaries use key-value pairs instead. It is equivalent to mapping (e.g. java Hashmap)
Keys are unique hence a insertion with the same key will override will the previous value, preserving insertion order.

Note .items() created a list in Python2 hence some earlier programmes may loop over the keys instead. Python 2.2 added .iteritems(), similar to Python3 .items(). Python3 uses a generator instead
Note that python3.6 now preserves the insertion order of dictionary keys
Delete is marginally better in performance than pop
In checks if a key is in the dictionary

Sets are an unorderedcollection and there is no way to retrieve a specific item from the set

a dictionary can store any object as a value, even other dictionaries or keys of another dictionary


====
	Dictionaries and sets are not sequences and cannot be accessed via index positions
	Python Dictionary is equivalent to a Java Hashmap (also known as mapping)
	Using a key ti get values from the dictionary, the dictionary stores key value pairs
	Dictionaries are defined using curly brackets and colons
{ ‘key’ : ‘value’ }
	using the key to access the value e.g. dict_name[‘keyvalue’]. Indexing is faster then get
	dictionary also has a get method e.g. dict_name.get(“keyvalue”). Get method will let you know if a key is not found (will return NONE)
	note that keys must match exactly, i.e. they are case sensitive. keys must be unique if not it will just update to the latest value pair
	you can iterate over the dictionary like sequences using loops
	.items method (similar to enumerate for sequences) - will be more efficient since it uses 
for key, value in dictionary.items():
	.iteritems() for Python 2.2
	in Python 3.6 onwards, dictionaries preserved the insertion order
	items can be added to the items. there is no append method
dict_name[“keyName”] = “valueName”
	you can also change the value of the dictionary
dict_name[“keyName”] = “newValueName”
	you can remove items from dictionary using the del function, but accessing the item by the key rather than then index, but similar to get, we should use pop incase the key name does not exist, and you can indicate the default return value
del dict_name[“keyName”]
dict_name.pop(“keyName”)
dict_name.pop(“keyName”, None)
	you can use IN to check ONLY the keys

using fstring to print ? print(f”stringtext{varName}”)

Why use a dictionary compared to a list?
is None the same as “0”?
“ The Zen of Python” zen.py import this
CPython - most of the implementation is written in C
	Sets are an unordered collection of things and there are no ways to retrieve a specific item from it
