Dictionaries and sets are not sequences and cannot be indexed into, 
Dictionaries use key-value pairs instead. It is equivalent to mapping (e.g. java Hashmap)
Keys are unique hence a insertion with the same key will override will the previous value, preserving insertion order.

Note .items() created a list in Python2 hence some earlier programmes may loop over the keys instead. Python2.2 added .iteritems(), similar to Python3 .items(). Python3 uses a generator instead
Note that Python3.6 now preserves the insertion order of dictionary keys
Delete is marginally better in performance than pop
In checks if a key is in the dictionary

Sets are an unordered collection and there is no way to retrieve a specific item from the set


Dictionaries literals are defined using curly brackets and colons { ‘key’ : ‘value’ }
A dictionary can store any object as a value, even other dictionaries or keys of another dictionary
