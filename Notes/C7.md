Dictionaries and sets are not sequences and cannot be indexed into, 
Dictionaries use key-value pairs instead. It is equivalent to mapping (e.g. java Hashmap)
Keys are unique hence a insertion with the same key will override will the previous value, preserving insertion order.

Note .items() created a list in Python2 hence some earlier programmes may loop over the keys instead. Python2.2 added .iteritems(), similar to Python3 .items(). Python3 uses a generator instead
Note that Python3.6 now preserves the insertion order of dictionary keys
Delete is marginally better in performance than pop
In checks if a key is in the dictionary

Sets are an unordered collection and there is no way to retrieve a specific item from the set

Dictionaries literals are defined using curly brackets and colons { ‘key’ : ‘value’ }
A dictionary can store any object as a value, even other dictionaries or keys of another dictionary

.items() in Python 2 created a list making  a copy of the data, and used more
memory. Earilier programs might have used the simple for loop, to avoid the extra memory
overhead of using .items().
Python 2.2 added a .iteritems() method, which works in a similar way to Python 3's
.items() method.
Python 3 now uses something called a generator, and doesn't copy the data from the
dictionary. With Python 3, remember to use enumerate when iterating over sequences, and .items()
when iterating over dictionaries. When you iterate over a dictionary with Python 3.7 and above, the keys will appear in the
order they were added to the dictionary.
