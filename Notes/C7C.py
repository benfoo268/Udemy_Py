# any python object can be a value in python 

# dictionary comprehensions is more efficient
# enumerate works with lists which returns a tuple with a numerated index
# change to str so you don't have to covert user input back

# receipes can either be modelled as a dictionary of a list of tuples, or a dictionary of a dictionary
# have to unpack the tuple or use items to return the dictionary key-values using .items()
# thinking ahead of your logic to determine the data structure or changing the logic
# tuple is a bad choice because you cannot quickly get the tuple, you need to iterate through the list and check each tuply by packing

# handle if pantry does not stock item
