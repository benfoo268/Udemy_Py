Dear Tim,
I am stuck in one problem.
I have one .csv file, which has four columns and thousands of rows.
I converted it to a dictionary, where first column is key and other three are value (a list, basically these are coordinates ) .
So, I want to find the corresponding key for a condition where the coordinates are in certain range. I tried many times but stuck.
Could you please help me for the same ? below are the codes i tried, but of course I cant fined the error.
Thanks in advance.

for example :
``` python
newDict = {1: [0.0, 0.194999993, 8.85261154], 2: [0.0, 0.146249995, 8.85261154], 3: [0.0, 0.0974999964, 8.85261154], 4: [0.0, 0.0487499982, 8.85261154], 5: [0.0, 0.0, 8.85261154], 6: [0.0, -0.0487499982, 8.85261154], 7: [0.0, -0.0974999964, 8.85261154], 8: [0.0, -0.146249995, 8.85261154], 9: [0.0, -0.194999993, 8.85261154], 10: [0.0, 0.194999993, 8.90174103]}
```

Now i need the keys corresponding to certain range of x, y, z.

I tried this way but it does not work.
``` python
keys = []
for key in newDict.keys():
    for x,y,z in newDict.values():
        if (0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 9):
            keys = [key]
```
Another way as well , this time it gives a lot of repeated value.
``` python
setA = [key for key, value in newDict.items() for x,y,z in newDict.values() if (0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 8)]
print(setA) 
```

Hi,

You're almost there with that first code sample, but you don't need the inner loop.

``` python
newDict = {1: [0.0, 0.194999993, 8.85261154],
           2: [0.0, 0.146249995, 8.85261154],
           3: [0.0, 0.0974999964, 8.85261154],
           4: [0.0, 0.0487499982, 8.85261154],
           5: [0.0, 0.0, 8.85261154],
           6: [0.0, -0.0487499982, 8.85261154],
           7: [0.0, -0.0974999964, 8.85261154],
           8: [0.0, -0.146249995, 8.85261154],
           9: [0.0, -0.194999993, 8.85261154],
           10: [0.0, 0.194999993, 8.90174103],
           11: [-1, .19, 6.5],
           12: [-1, .19, 7.5],
           13: [0.45, .19, 7.5],
           14: [0.45, 1.9, 7.5],
           15: [0.54, .19, 7.5],
           16: [0.5, -1.9, 7.5],
           17: [0.5, 0.5, 6],
           18: [0.5, 0.5, 8],
           }
 
matching_keys = []
for key in newDict:
    x, y, z = newDict[key]
    if (0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 9):
        print(key, newDict[key])
        matching_keys.append(key)
 
print()
print(matching_keys)
```

The loop may be more efficient as

``` python
matching_keys = []
for key, value in newDict.items():
    x, y, z = value
    if (0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 9):
        print(key, value)
        matching_keys.append(key)
```

If you want to use a comprehension:

``` python
matching_keys = [key for key, value in newDict.items()
                 if ((0 <= value[0] <= 0.5) and (0 <= value[1] <= 0.5) and (7 <= value[2] <= 9))]
``` 

It's not quite perfect though :-(.  I wasn't thinking about unpacking value in the comprehension.  Using

``` python
matching_keys = [key for key, (x, y, z) in newDict.items()
                 if ((0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 9))]
```

is clearer (and more efficient).  You can unpack the list while iterating over the items.
If you don't want to print value in the for loop, you can use the same technique there:

``` python
matching_keys = []
for key, (x, y, z) in newDict.items():
    if (0 <= x <= 0.5) and (0 <= y <= 0.5) and (7 <= z <= 9):
        matching_keys.append(key)
```
